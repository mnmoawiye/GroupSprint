SDLC Capstone — Sprint 1 Process Analysis
Course: Software Quality Assurance

Sprint: Sprint 1

Model Selected: Waterfall

Submission Type: Solo

Due: End of class Thursday

Section 1 — Model Selection and Rationale
<!-- Choose one SDLC model: Waterfall, Agile/Scrum, or V-Model. Argue that it best describes how Sprint 1 actually ran. Your rationale must connect specific model characteristics to specific evidence from your project — your spec, your GitHub Issues, your swap structure, your retrospective. If you choose Waterfall: address why Sprint 1's feedback loops and iterative fixes do not disqualify it. If you choose V-Model: identify the specific parallel between your dev phases and your test phases. -->

Selected Model: Waterfall

Rationale: Sprint 1 mostly followed the Waterfall model because we worked step by step. First, we made a spec for our Python Tamagotchi game, planning all the main features like eat, sleep, play, and evolve.

Then we built the game based on that plan. Most of the bugs, like the “Play” command increasing hunger and the evolution status showing too early, were found during the Week 6 swap after we finished coding.

Any changes we made after testing were part of maintenance. Even though we had a retrospective and small feedback, the project basically went in order: plan - build - test - fix, which is what Waterfall is all about.
